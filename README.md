# Hybrid Book Design

This repsoitory contains templates for two hybrid book designs released under a **TBD** license. The files can be used as is or addapted to you needs. Commissioned by the Hybrid Publishing LAb at Leuphana University of Lüneburg these designs were created by Torsten Köchlin **LINK**.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**


The book designs were created for the purposes of scholarly book publishing in the humanities and adjacent disciplines. They are hybid since they provide a strong and coherent visual identity for both fixed/page based layouts such as printed books as well as reflowable layouts employed in HTML and EBooks.

The aesthetics of both designs is quite similar, but they differ in complexity. We provide: 

1. A book design for smaller, less complex publications. The page size for print layouts is 127mm x 178mm.
2. B book design for longer, more complex publications. The page size for print layouts is ???.

The design makes use of the open font "Open Sans" that can be downloaded for free from [Fontsquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans) and multiple other locations on the internet.
