# Importing Microsoft Word Files into Adobe Indesign 
The follwoing manual applies to the import of word files that are based on the template

**WORD TEMPLATE TITLE**

into one of the two indesign book design templates

**INDESIGN TEMPLATE FILE A**
**INDESIGN TEMPLATE FILE B**
  
A general description of how to import Word file into Indesign can be found in the documentation provided by Adobe for the desktop publishing software.

##The General Idea
Adobe Indesign allows it's users to place files within a document (Menu: File/Place, Mac Shotcut: cmd +D). Usually this is used to insert  image files in a design. However text files can be placed as well. When doing this Indesign offers it's users to define their import preferences. Here is where the magic happens because paragraph and character styles used in the Word file can be mapped onto predefined paragraph and character styles of Indesign. Even though this mapping does not work properly in every instance it's a powerful tool to produce a book based on a word document. 

##The Process
In case you want to use the book design we provided there are just a few steps to take and things to consider:

1. Use the template for Microsoft Word we provided to write your manuscript or to mark up an existing manuscript. Information on how to use the template can be found in the Style Guide.
2. Before importing the final manuscript into Adobe Indesign you need to install a mapping file. This step isn't required but highly recommended. Of course you can define the mapping of paragraph and character styles yourself using the Indesign Word Importer Dialog. By installing the mapping file you, however, don't have define these mappings by hand, but just choose the according mapping preferences.
